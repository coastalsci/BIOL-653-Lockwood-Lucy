Lucy is editing this R Markdown document. I might finally learn git and R.

# Formating Examples

Note the header above created for this section.
*This sentence is formatted in italic.*

**Whereas this sentence is formatted with bold.**

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
