# BIOL653 Lockwood
**Homework 1 for Biology 653 class**
This is a basic README file in Rmarkdown.  
The purpose of this file is to show that I can use some basic formatting techniques.
## Formatting Techniques Displayed ##
*Italics*
**Bold**
## Headings and Lists ##
1. One can make numbered lists.
2. The numbered lists could contain *formatting*.
  + There could be subitems in the list.
  + And those subitems could have ~~donuts~~ formatting.

Software is great - when it works. When however hidden startup files make it so RStudio won't even load and you don't know why - then it is less fun. :-<
